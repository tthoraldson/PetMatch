PetMatch
==============================

Petmatch seeks to provide users with curated rescue animal recommendations in the hope that it will 
lead to higher adoptions rates and lower return rates to shelters. This will be accomplished through
the use of a recommendation model that extends an existing model in order to include no-kill shelters.
We will also build a serverless full-stack pipeline and a Tinder-like UI that matches adoptable pets
with potential adopters.
