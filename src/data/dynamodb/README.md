# Storing user preferences

## User preferences table

here's an example of a DynamoDB table schema that uses a unique user id as the primary key, and includes a timestamp generated by DynamoDB when a new item is added:

### Table Name: "UserPreferences"

- Primary key: "user_id" (string)
Sort key: "timestamp" (number) - This can be a timestamp generated - by DynamoDB when a new item is added
- "dog_size" (string)
- "dog_energy" (string)
- "dog_breed" (string)
- "cat_size" (string)
- "cat_energy" (string)
- "cat_breed" (string)
- "full_name" (string)
- "email" (string)
- "zip_code" (number)
- "readiness" (string)
- "age" (number)
- "g_expression" (string)
- "has_current_pets" (string)
- "current_pets" (string)

You can use the user_id as the primary key to query for a specific user's preferences, and the timestamp to query for all users by the time they were added.

You can also create secondary indexes on other attributes, such as "email", "zip_code" and "readiness" to allow for more flexible querying.


## Rankings table

### Table Name: "Rankings"

here's an example of a DynamoDB table schema for a table called "Rankings" that has a foreign key to the "user_id" primary key in the other table, and has the following attributes:


- Primary key: "user_id" (string) - foreign key to the "user_id" primary key in the other table
- Sort key: "pet_id" (string)
- "response" (number)


This table allows you to store the ranking made by a user to a specific pet. The primary key is "user_id" which is a foreign key to the "user_id" primary key in the other table, and the sort key is "pet_id" which allows you to query for all the ranking made by a user to a specific pet.

You can also create secondary indexes on other attributes, such as "pet_id" to allow for more flexible querying of ranking made by a specific pet.


## Expanding the schema for collaborative filtering and content-based filtering

There are several queries and attributes that could help get more valuable insights to help match aspiring pet owners to potential dogs and cats:

"Previous pet ownership experience" - This attribute could help identify if a user has previously owned a pet and if so, what type of pet they owned. This could help match them with a pet that has similar characteristics to their previous pet.

"Living arrangements" - This attribute could help identify if a user lives in an apartment, a house, or has a yard. This could help match them with a pet that is suitable for their living arrangements.

"Activity level" - This attribute could help identify how active a user is and how much time they are willing to spend exercising a pet. This could help match them with a pet that has a similar energy level.

"Training experience" - This attribute could help identify if a user has experience training a pet and if so, what type of training they are comfortable with. This could help match them with a pet that is easier to train.

"Frequency of travel" - This attribute could help identify how often a user travels and how long they are away from home. This could help match them with a pet that is comfortable being alone for extended periods.

"Children in the household" - This attribute could help identify if a user has children in the household and if so, what ages they are. This could help match them with a pet that is comfortable around children.

"Queries based on the ranking" - You can make queries to the "Rankings" table based on the user_id and pet_id to get the ranking made by a user to a specific pet. Then you can use this data to personalize the pet recommendations for each user.
